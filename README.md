# July Recess Python Experiments

## Description

- This repository contains various Python experiments and tests that I worked on during my July recess. It includes different implementations and examples as I explored and practiced Python programming. The content is organized in a way that showcases various concepts and techniques I was learning about.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

`````bash

│
├── NORMAL/
│   ├── q2_teste.py        # Reworking a question from a test taken before the recess
│   ├── q3_teste.py        # Same as above, another test question
│   └── q3_testePOO.py     # Converted the previous question to an object-oriented approach
│
